# üè® Hotel Management Dashboard API

A backend service built with **FastAPI**, powering the Hotel Management Dashboard.

## üß± Virtual Environment Setup

1. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üöÄ Starting the Application

### Option 1: Run Locally with FastAPI

Start the development server:

```bash
fastapi dev main.py
```

Then access the application at:
‚û°Ô∏è [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

You can also view the interactive API documentation at:
‚û°Ô∏è [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) (Swagger UI)

## üìÑ PDF Generation (WeasyPrint)

This project uses [WeasyPrint](https://weasyprint.org) to generate high-quality PDFs.

### üõ†Ô∏è System Dependencies

WeasyPrint requires some additional **system-level libraries** (like Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf) that must be installed before usage.

### ‚úÖ Setup Instructions

Follow the official platform-specific installation guide here:
üëâ [WeasyPrint Installation Guide](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/stable/first_steps.html)

> Failure to install these dependencies will result in PDF generation errors.

Installing these manually can be tedious.

### ‚úÖ Recommended: Use Docker
To avoid installing dependencies locally, simply use:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start a container with all required libraries and dependencies pre-installed, including WeasyPrint, making PDF generation work out of the box.

This is the easiest and most reliable way to get started.

If you use the Docker approach you can access the application at:
‚û°Ô∏è [http://0.0.0.0:8000](http://0.0.0.0:800) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have Docker Compose installed. If not, follow [Docker's installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to set it up.
- Adjust Dockerfile or Compose configurations as needed based on your environment and requirements.
